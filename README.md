Suicide occurs more often in older than in younger people but is still one of 
the leading causes of death in late childhood and adolescence worldwide. This 
not only results in a direct loss of many young lives, but also has disruptive 
psychosocial and adverse socio-economic effects. From the perspective of 
public mental health, suicide among young people is a main issue to address. 
Therefore, we need good insight in the risk factors contributing to suicidal 
behavior in youth. This mini review gives a short overview of the most 
important risk factors for late school-age children and adolescents, as 
established by scientific research in this domain. Key risk factors found were 
mental disorders, previous suicide attempts, specific personality 
characteristics, genetic loading, and family processes in combination with 
triggering psychosocial stressors, exposure to inspiring models and 
availability of means of committing suicide. Further unraveling and 
knowledge of the complex interplay of these factors is highly relevant with 
regard to the development of effective prevention strategy plans for youth 
suicide.
